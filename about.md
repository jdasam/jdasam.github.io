[CV in pdf]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Dasaem_Jeong_CV.pdf)

I'm currently working as an assistant professor at the [Department of Art & Technology](http://creative.sogang.ac.kr/) in [Sogang University](https://www.sogang.ac.kr/), also affiliated in the [Department of AI](https://ai.sogang.ac.kr/). Before joining as a faculty, I worked as a researcher in T-Brain X/SK telecom. I've finished my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Prof. Juhan Nam](https://mac.kaist.ac.kr/~juhan/) in [Music and Audio Computing (MAC) Lab](http://mac.kaist.ac.kr), Graduate School of Culture Technology [(GSCT)](http://ct.kaist.ac.kr), Korea Advanced Institue of Science and Technology [(KAIST)](http://www.kaist.ac.kr).

My research interest includes Creative AI, Expressive Performance Modeling, Music Visualization, Automatic Music Transcription, Audio-to-Score Alignment, Performance Analysis, Web Audio API, and Computational Musicology.

I love classical music a lot. This is the reason why my research interest is focused mainly on classical music. I've played the cello in KAIST Orchestra, and taken lessons for orchestral conducting.
